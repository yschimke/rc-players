# Regenerate the text-metric fixtures, render them on the three server-side lanes, and compose the
# strips committed under `renders/rc-text-metrics/`.
#
# This is the whole recipe, deliberately in one place. The commands underneath have three separate
# ways to look like they worked while producing nothing or something stale, and every one of them
# has already caught someone out:
#
#   * `rc.embedded.input` must be an **absolute** path. The harness resolves it against the *test*
#     working directory, not the repo root, and a path it cannot resolve fails an `assumeTrue` —
#     which Gradle reports as a skipped test inside a green build. A relative path therefore prints
#     `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` and writes no PNGs at all.
#   * `--rerun` (a *task* option, so it follows the task name) is needed because the input arrives
#     as a system property rather than a declared task input. Without it the second run is
#     `UP-TO-DATE` and silently keeps the previous run's PNGs.
#   * `--tests` is needed because `rc.embedded.input` reaches **every** test in that module.
#     Unfiltered, `RcSemanticsExtractionTest` and `RcFigmaSvgExportTest` pick the first staged
#     document up as if it were a catalog capture and fail against it — *after* the PNGs are
#     written, so the regeneration looks broken when it isn't.
#

# module, not the repo root — so a relative lane directory would have the two harness modules write
# into two different places, neither of which is where this script then looks. Same trap as
# `rc.embedded.input` above, one level out. `mkdir -p` first so `cd` can resolve it.
