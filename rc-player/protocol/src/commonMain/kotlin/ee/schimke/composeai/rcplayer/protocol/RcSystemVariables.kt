/**
 * The ids AndroidX's `RemoteContext` reserves for values the **player** supplies, not the document.
 *
 * A document never allocates in this range: writers start their own ids well above it (42 in every
 * catalog this repo publishes), and a `NaN`-boxed word pointing here is a request for something the
 * host knows — the wall clock, the animation clock, the viewport. Because the reference is an
 * ordinary float word, a player that does not load these ids does not fail loudly: the reference
 * resolves to its own raw `NaN` bits and the arithmetic downstream quietly produces `NaN`, so the
 * shape built from it is never drawn. That is exactly how the `remote-m3` catalog's indeterminate
 * circular progress indicator came to render as an empty frame in the CMP/Wasm lane (#4264) while
 * the AndroidX and TypeScript players — both of which load these — animated it.
 *
 * Only the ids this player actually supplies are named here. The sensor, touch and viewport blocks
 * AndroidX also reserves are deliberately absent: naming an id we do not load would suggest a
 * support this player does not have.
