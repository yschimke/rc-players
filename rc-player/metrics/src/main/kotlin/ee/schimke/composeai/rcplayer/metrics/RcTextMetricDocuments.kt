/**
 * Remote Compose documents that **measure their own text and draw the answer as guide lines**.
 *
 * The problem these exist for: comparing text across the five player lanes has only ever produced a
 * pixel percentage. "wear-m3 renders heavier", "compose-m3 renders narrower" — true, unactionable,
 * and equally consistent with a substituted face, a wrong weight instance, a wrong advance, a wrong
 * ascent, or leading placed on the other side of the line. A diff cannot separate those. So instead
 * of diffing the *glyphs*, these fixtures make each lane draw the *numbers it laid the glyphs out
 * with*, and diff those.
 *
 * The mechanism needs no *new* opcode, only one that a lane already executes:
 * 1. `TextMeasure` (opcode 155) measures the current paint's text and writes one number into a
 *    float id;
 * 2. a float id is a legal draw coordinate;
 * 3. so a line drawn *at* that float is the lane's own measurement, rendered by the lane itself.
 *
 * The first render exposed that `cmp-android` and `cmp-jvm` decoded `TextMeasure` but never
 * executed it. The operation is now implemented by every player in this repo; the fixtures remain
 * the conformance probe that makes a missing write or a bounds-semantics regression visible.
 *
 * The canvas is translated to the text origin before the guides are drawn, which is what keeps this
 * arithmetic-free: `getTextBounds` reports origin-relative horizontals and baseline-relative
 * verticals, so after the translate every measured value *is* the coordinate to draw at. No float
 * expression sits between the measurement and the line, and therefore no question about whether an
 * expression was evaluated before or after the measure op.
 *
 * ## The two text paths
 *
 * RC measures text in two unrelated places, and this is the fault line most likely to explain lane
 * disagreement — `RcProfileDocuments` states it for the profiler and it matters more here:
 * canvas-drawn text (`DrawTextRun`) is measured by the *player*, and is therefore the only path
 * `TextMeasure` can see; layout-tree text (`TextLayout`) hands the string to the host stack, which
 * owns measurement, shaping, wrapping and ellipsis and opens no seam to ask.
 *
 * Both paths are covered for the same string and style. [metricCard] and [weightSweep] draw the
 * canvas path with its metrics exposed; [layoutMode] draws the layout path inside a box whose rect
 * is known and whose single-line advance is measured on the canvas path beside it. So a mode
 * fixture shows where the host stack *actually* broke, clipped or ellipsised the line, against
 * where the player's own measurement says the line ends. A divergence that appears on one path and
 * not the other is localised the moment it appears.

   * had simply hard-coded start→left would pass a six-alignment matrix built only from LTR text
   * while being wrong for every RTL user, so the pair is drawn twice: once in each script.
   *
   * **This asks the question; it does not answer it.** `CoreText` carries no layout direction —
   * AOSP derives its only flags word from `textAlign >>> 16` — so a document cannot state that its
   * container is RTL, and the render harnesses all run their default LTR one. Resolving `START`
   * against an LTR container and resolving it to `LEFT` outright therefore look identical here.
   * Separating them needs a lane rendered under an RTL layout direction, which is a harness change
   * rather than a fixture one. The pair is still worth drawing: it is the half that can be
   * expressed, and both host stacks would ordinarily flip on content alone.
   *
   * If a lane has no face covering the script the fixture renders tofu — which still shows *where*
   * the line was placed, and is itself a font-coverage finding rather than a broken fixture.

   * The same string at five weights, each row reporting **two** numbers: the advance, and the width
   * of the ink box.
   *
   * This is how the variable-font question gets *measured* rather than inferred. #3579 concluded
   * that Google Fonts' CSS API had flattened `wght@450` and `wght@550` to one instance because the
   * two downloads were byte-identical — a strong hint, but a file-size argument. Here the question
   * is asked of the renderer directly.
   *
   * Two numbers rather than one, because **equal advances do not prove a reused face**. Families
   * are routinely drawn duplexed on purpose, keeping identical advances across weights while only
   * the stems thicken. So the advance answers a narrower question than it looks like it answers:
   * "would this weight reflow the layout". The ink box — `right - left` of `getTextBounds`, a
   * different measurement off a different code path — fails independently of it.
   *
   * Neither number is a proof on its own. What the pair gives you, read together with the glyphs
   * beside them, is a signature:
   * - both move → the weight reached a metric-distinct instance;
   * - both flat, glyphs identical → the weight changed nothing at all;
   * - both flat, glyphs visibly bolder → the weight is **metrically identical** while the glyphs
   *   are not.
   *
   * The reference render lands on the third: 362.0 advance and 359.0 ink for 500, 550, 599 and 700
   * alike, with 700 plainly heavier than 500. Resist reading that as "synthesised rather than
   * resolved" — `getTextBounds` reports the run's outer rectangle, so a genuinely resolved bold
   * that thickens its stems *inward*, keeping the advance and the extrema, gives the same numbers.
   * Every row is a statement about metrics, which is what decides layout; identifying why the
   * metrics match needs the resolved face, which this harness cannot report. The ink box is also
   * integer-quantised (`Paint.getTextBounds` returns a `Rect`), so it is a coarse instrument at
   * this size — one more reason to read it as corroboration rather than as the answer.
   *
   * 550 and 599 are in the sweep on purpose. They are the values that fall between the static
   * instances a weight-enumerated stylesheet ships, so they are where a "nearest static instance"
   * fallback becomes visible; Wear's `TimeText` really does land on 599.

   * of the two carrying line height (properties 13 and 14), which is a metric this harness exists
   * to isolate. The colour travels as a `ColorConstant` id rather than a literal for the same
   * reason — that is the shape real documents use, and a fixture that exercises a path nothing else
   * takes is a fixture that can pass while the shipping path is broken.
   *
   * The family is deliberately left unnamed. `resolveFontFamily` maps both a missing id and the
   * literal `"default"` to the same branch, so naming it bought nothing while implying the fixture
   * pins a face. It does not, and cannot yet: that branch consults the host's font manifest for the
   * `default` role, whereas the overlay's canvas paint decodes built-in family 0 straight to
   * `FontFamily.Default`. With no manifest — every lane rendered so far — the two agree; on a lane
   * that installs one they may not, which is a limit on comparing the two paths there until a face
