/**
 * Exercises the **jvm half of the canvas text seam** — `RcPlayerTextPlatformJvm.kt`'s four
 * functions — on a plain desktop JVM, rasterizing through skiko with no Android and no Robolectric.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and what deliberately is not
 *
 * Not asserted: any particular number. Android's font stack and the host's are different, so
 * metrics are not comparable across the seam and pinning a width here would pin *this container's
 * fonts*. `PROVENANCE.md` records that as a parity limit; the seam's value is that both halves
 * answer the same four questions, not that they answer them identically.
 *
 * Asserted instead: the **relationships the callers in `RcPlayerDrawing.kt` depend on**. Chiefly
 * [inkBoundsPredictWhereTheGlyphsLand] — `DrawTextAnchored` measures ink bounds, does arithmetic on
 * `left`/`top`, then draws at the result, so measurement and drawing agreeing about the origin *is*
 * the contract. A jvm half that measured with one face and drew with another would pass every other
 * test in this file and fail that one.
 *
 * Face *selection* is not asserted either — that a family id resolves to a specific typeface
 * depends on what fonts the host has, and an assertion about that would be testing fontconfig. What
 * is covered is that every family id, including an unresolvable one, produces a usable face rather
 * than throwing or measuring zero.

class DesktopTextPlatformTest {

  /**
   * Skips the class when skiko's native library cannot be loaded at all, rather than reporting a
   * cryptic `NoClassDefFoundError` against every method.
   *
   * `libskiko-<host>.so` has a link-time dependency on the platform's GL library even for the
   * purely raster drawing this test does, so a host without one — or, as in the container this was
   * written in, a JVM whose dynamic loader cannot see the one that is installed — cannot run *any*
   * of it. That is an environment fact, not a fault in the code under test, and reporting it as
   * sixteen failures buries the one line that says so.
   *
   * The skip is deliberately noisy: a quiet one would let this whole file evaporate on CI and still
   * report green, which is worse than no test. If it prints, fix the environment — on Linux that
   * means `libgl1`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` covering it for the JVM that runs the tests. Note
   * Gradle's test workers inherit the *daemon's* environment, so a daemon started before that was
   * exported keeps the old one; `./gradlew --stop` first.
