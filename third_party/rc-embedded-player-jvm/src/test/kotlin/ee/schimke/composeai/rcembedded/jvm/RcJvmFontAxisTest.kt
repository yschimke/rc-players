/**
 * A variable font's axes reach the family the jvm player draws with.
 *
 * The resolver is asked for the same face twice at different `wdth` instances: those are two
 * different faces of one file, so they must be two different `FontFamily` objects. Handing the
 * second request the first's family — which is what a cache keyed on `(family, weight, italic)`
 * alone does — is exactly how a `wght` ramp ends up drawing every line at the first weight it saw.
 *
 * Hermetic: the [GoogleFontSource] is faked over the repo's vendored Roboto Flex, so nothing is
 * fetched. (`RcFontAxisRenderTest` in `:rc-player-compose` measures the *rendered* ink for the same
 * claim; this one pins the resolver's own contract.)
