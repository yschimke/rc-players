/**
 * TEXT_LAYOUT (208) — the fixed-field text component.
 *
 * Semantically this is the same thing as `CoreText` (239): a `LayoutManager` that
 * measures a string and paints it. The two differ only in how they are encoded.
 * `CoreText` carries a variable-length parameter bag (`readCommandParams`), while
 * `TEXT_LAYOUT` carries a fixed positional record of the eleven fields below —
 * the narrower form emitted by the Glance Wear widget capture
 * (`WearWidgetDocument.captureRawContent`) and by `remote-material3`'s
 * `RemoteText`.
 *
 * It was previously a parse-only stub: the reader consumed the right number of
 * bytes (so the stream stayed aligned and nothing downstream reported an unknown
 * opcode) but discarded every field and painted nothing. A document whose text
 * came through this op therefore replayed as its background alone — silently, and
 * with no truncation warning to give it away. Extending `CoreText` reuses its
 * measure/layout/paint path wholesale; only the wire decoding differs.
 *
 * The fields absent from this encoding take the same defaults `CoreText.read`
 * applies when the parameter bag omits them.
