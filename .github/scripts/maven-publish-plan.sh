# Decide which modules a release actually has to publish.
#
# Until now every release uploaded all 8 coordinates at the tag, whether or not a byte of them
# changed. Each coordinate-publish is 20 files against an org-wide Maven Central file-count limit
# that all of yschimke's publishing repositories share (yschimke/compose-ai-tools#4772), and the
# KMP modules here multiply that: `rc-player-compose` alone ships Android, JVM, wasm and five Apple
# variants. Replaying the whole set 19 times over the last 30 days is most of this repository's
# share of that limit.
#
# Measured over v1.54.0..v1.63.0 — 19 release intervals, 152 module-publications — these rules
# would have published 57 of them: 38%. The remaining 62% was bytes nobody touched.
#
# Ported from compose-preview-daemon, where the same script runs; the rules below are its rules.
#
# A module is published when:
#
#   1. a file under it changed since the tag IT last published at (not since the last release —
#      a module skipped for three releases is compared against its own baseline, so nothing is
#      ever missed by a gap), or
#   2. a module it depends on is being published, or
#   3. a shared build input changed, which can move every artifact at once.
#
# Rule 2 is what keeps the POMs honest, and it is deliberately coarser than it needs to be. A
# published POM names its project dependencies at *their* `project.version`, so a module may only
# be skipped while everything it depends on is also skipped; otherwise it would name a sibling
# version that was never uploaded — exactly the break compose-ai-tools shipped in v2.2.1 and paid
# for in yschimke/wear-m3-catalog#350. Propagating on any change rather than only on an ABI change
# costs about 6 percentage points (73% -> 67%) and needs no assumption about binary compatibility;
# tighten it only when the modules carry ABI dumps to prove the surface held.
#
# Every uncertainty resolves to "publish". Central refuses a second upload of a version, so an
# unnecessary publish costs quota while a wrongly-skipped one is unrepairable.
#
# Usage: maven-publish-plan.sh --head <ref> [--manifest <path>]
# Output: one artifact id per line, on stdout. Diagnostics go to stderr.
