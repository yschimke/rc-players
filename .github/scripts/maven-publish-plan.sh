# Decide which modules a release actually has to publish.
#
# Until now every release uploaded all 8 coordinates at the tag, whether or not a byte of them
# changed. Each coordinate-publish is 20 files against an org-wide Maven Central file-count limit
# that all of yschimke's publishing repositories share (yschimke/compose-ai-tools#4772), and the
# KMP modules here multiply that: `rc-player-compose` alone ships Android, JVM, wasm and five Apple
# variants. Replaying the whole set 19 times over the last 30 days is most of this repository's
# share of that limit.
#
# Measured over v1.54.0..v1.63.0 — 19 release intervals, 152 module-publications — these rules
# would have published 57 of them: 38%. The remaining 62% was bytes nobody touched.
#
# Ported from compose-preview-daemon, where the same script runs; the rules below are its rules.
#
# A module is published when:
#
#   1. a file under it changed since the tag IT last published at (not since the last release —
#      a module skipped for three releases is compared against its own baseline, so nothing is
#      ever missed by a gap), or
#   2. a module it depends on is being published, or
#   3. a shared build input changed, which can move every artifact at once, or
#   4. the version catalog changed an entry used by a build script among its inputs (a catalog
#      entry that a shared build file uses is rule 3 instead, and publishes everything).
#
# Rules 3 and 4 follow compose-preview-daemon's copy of this script (#193, #194), measured against
# this repository's releases since the plan landed (v1.64.0..v2.0.3, where 10 of 16 releases
# published every module):
#
#   - `build-logic/src/test/**`, whole-line comment and whitespace edits to shared Kotlin files, and
#     anything in VERIFICATION_ONLY never reach an artifact.
#   - SIBLING COORDINATES ARE FLOORS, NOT INPUTS. A catalog entry naming another
#     `ee.schimke.composeai` coordinate (compose-preview-contracts, compose-preview-daemon) is
#     ignored. A bump changes no byte built here, only the minimum version the POMs name: Gradle
#     resolves the highest one in the graph and consumers align through each repository's BOM. A
#     sibling VERSION a build script reads as a value stays an input, since it can be baked into an
#     artifact. v2.0.3 was a contracts bump and nothing else, and republished every player.
#   - Release wiring lives in `root-tasks.gradle.kts`, outside the shared set: it decides which
#     tasks run, not what they build.
#
# Dependency scans read code, not comments: a `project(":…")` named in prose is not an edge.
#
# "A file under it" means every input the module packages, not just its own directory (#512). A
# module's inputs are the directories of every project in its transitive project-dependency
# closure — followed through UNPUBLISHED projects too — plus any path outside its directory that it
# reads. Two published modules went stale on Central without this:
#
#   - `rc-player-wasm-dist` zips `:rc-player-wasm`, which is unpublished and depends on
#     `:rc-player-compose`. Rule 2 only walks published edges, so a compose-only release (v1.71.0,
#     v1.75.0) left Central's wasm-dist built from the previous compose code.
#   - `remote-compose-player-js-dist` packages `../remote-compose-player/dist`, a sibling directory
#     with no build file, so no project edge reaches it at all.
#
# Paths outside a project's directory are picked up from `"../…"` literals in its build file, and
# anything a build file cannot express that way is declared in EXTRA_INPUTS below. A dependency on
# a project path this script cannot resolve, or an input path that escapes the repository, makes
# every published module that reaches it publish.
#
# Rule 2 is what keeps the POMs honest, and it is deliberately coarser than it needs to be. A
# published POM names its project dependencies at *their* `project.version`, so a module may only
# be skipped while everything it depends on is also skipped; otherwise it would name a sibling
# version that was never uploaded — exactly the break compose-ai-tools shipped in v2.2.1 and paid
# for in yschimke/wear-m3-catalog#350. Propagating on any change rather than only on an ABI change
# costs about 6 percentage points (73% -> 67%) and needs no assumption about binary compatibility;
# tighten it only when the modules carry ABI dumps to prove the surface held.
#
# Every uncertainty resolves to "publish". Central refuses a second upload of a version, so an
# unnecessary publish costs quota while a wrongly-skipped one is unrepairable.
#
# Usage: maven-publish-plan.sh --head <ref> [--manifest <path>]
# Output: one artifact id per line, on stdout. Diagnostics go to stderr.
